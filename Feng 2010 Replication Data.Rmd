# Executive Summary / Write-Up

## Objective

Our objective was to reproduce, as much as possible and given the supplementary material, the results of the Feng et al paper, which can be found summarized in Table 1 (14258), with robustness checks in Table 2 (14259)


## Progress and Stumbling Blocks

First, given all the papers weâ€™ve read with data and scripts that were, however flawed, available online, it was surprising to see that this was not the case for the paper.  Although the supplementary material was much appreciated, as it makes it easier to understand the context of the data, it is impossible to know whether one was taking the same steps as the authors without having access to the code the authors used itself.


## Results
